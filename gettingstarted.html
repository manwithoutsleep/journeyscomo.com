                    <h3>Making an appointment</h3>
                    <p>At Journeys Christian Counseling most of our clients love to use our on-line system to make
                        appointments!
                        Just click on the Appointment buttons throughout our website to set up a client record with us
                        and pick a
                        session time that is convenient for you. Once you have your password, you can access our
                        scheduling system
                        anytime in the day or night and make changes or add new appointments.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The First Session & Forms</h3>
                    <p>If you are a new client with us, please print out the New Client Registration Form (required) by
                        clicking
                        on the button on the left. Please fill out this form prior to meeting with your counselor in
                        order to better
                        prepare you for your time together. If you are coming in for a Couples Session, please also
                        complete the
                        short couples form (optional). If you don't have a chance to print and fill out the New Client
                        Registration
                        form, we'll take a few minutes at the beginning of your session to get that taken care of.</p>

                    <h3>Counseling Fees</h3>
                    <p>The fee for an individual, couples, or family session is $95. Each session lasts 50 minutes. The
                        fee for
                        each session will be due and must be paid at the conclusion of each session unless otherwise
                        arranged. Cash,
                        personal checks, credit/debit cards, and health savings cards are acceptable for payment.</p>

                    <h3>Cancellations</h3>
                    <p>When you schedule an appointment time, that time is specifically reserved for you. If unable to
                        keep an
                        appointment, notification by phone 24 hours before your scheduled time is required. You will be
                        charged the
                        full fee for any missed appointments without 24 hour notice.</p>
