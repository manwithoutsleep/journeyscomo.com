          <h3>INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING</h3>
          <p>Each individual is unique, with their own experiences, interpretations, and beliefs. A variety of
            circumstances can keep us from experiencing freedom and enjoyment of life. We want to carefully collaborate
            with you to build hope and purpose in your heart, your life and your relationships, restoring freedom and
            enjoyment.</p>

          <h3>COUPLES COUNSELING</h3>
          <p>Arguments, disagreements, loneliness, and hurt&hellip; there is nothing more joyful when our primary
            relationships are working well, and nothing more painful when they are not! In couples therapy our focus
            will be to understand what is going on, particularly as it relates to the patterns that exist in the
            relationship and then, we'll work to de-escalate negative cycles and introduce new patterns of relating to
            one another.</p>

          <h3>FAMILY COUNSELING</h3>
          <p>In Family Therapy, the family is seen as a "whole" system, rather than just as the sum of its individual
            members. Including various members of the family can be beneficial to a wide variety of therapeutic goals
            including education or insight into family dynamics. Family therapy helps promote greater encouragement and
            support among all members of the family.</p>

          <h3>GROUP COUNSELING</h3>
          <p>Group therapy happens when people from all different walks of life come together with a common focus. Group
            therapy offers several benefits&hellip; by listening carefully to others and their experiences you can
            experience new insights and find out that you are not alone in your struggles.</p>
