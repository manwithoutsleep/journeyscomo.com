                    <p>Hi, I'm Cheryl.</p>
                    <p>In the counseling journey, I hope to walk alongside and help people as they address a variety of
                        challenges and struggles throughout life. My passion became my profession when I left a career
                        as a Systems Analyst and earned a Master's of Education Degree in Counseling from Stephens
                        College. As a Counselor, I look forward to joining you on your journey because meaningful change
                        and/or healing can make a significant difference in the quality of your life and relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>I offer a safe, compassionate, and confidential environment where we will work together to build
                        on your strengths and give you some new tools to overcome your unique difficulties. Maybe you
                        need a little help moving beyond a bump in the road or you need supports as you are feeling
                        overwhelmed like you're pushing a boulder up a hill. Life difficulties come in all kinds of
                        shapes and sizes.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to best match therapy with your unique needs, personality, and life experiences. I use
                        an integrated approach, leaning most heavily into attachment theory and drawing upon
                        tools/techniques from cognitive-behavioral, experiential, structural, narrative, and
                        psychoanalytic schools of thought. Spiritual truths are also a part of the mix as my Christian
                        faith influences who I am as a person and counselor.</p>
                    <p>When individuals are part of a couple or family they become part of a system. By understanding
                        and respecting this system, couples and families in therapy can experience meaningful change. I
                        have a heart for helping marriages because of the pain and hopelessness that can develop within
                        a system under stress. Sometimes a little help can make a big difference!</p>
